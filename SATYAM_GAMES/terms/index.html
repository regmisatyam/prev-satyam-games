                websites, apps, and games running.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">To use our services, you must be of legal age that is required by your country to
            form a binding contract with us and
            only in compliance with this agreement, any applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules,
            and
            regulations. If you have been held ineligible, or been blocked by us, you should not use our service.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">Before you download, install, or use our apps, you must check the source of your
            download to confirm whether the apps
            are suitable for you. You must confirm that you understand the content rating of the apps that you intend to
            play.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Free Service</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">Some of the Services that are available to you for viewing, downloading,
            installing, using and playing without any
            charge are Free Services. Advertisements support the Free Service, so you may be presented with different
            types of
            advertising banners, text, images, videos, or other digital presentations while you are browsing the
            website, or using
            our apps. You may be able to use some of the apps without an active internet connection on your device. The
            free
            Services might not be available for free in the future as we may limit access to those services, and you may
            be required
            to purchase a license or subscription to continue using such Services.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Paid Upgrades</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">Paid Upgrades are the features that are only available after you make payment.
            You can make a one-time payment via
            Google Play or App Store to enable access to the Paid Upgrades. You agree that you will not attempt to
            bypass the
            payment method to access the Paid Upgrades without making a payment. We may limit access to the Paid
            Upgrades in our
            sole determination if we believe you have obtained access to the Paid Upgrades without making a payment. We
            may change
            the price of the Paid Upgrades at any time, and the changes will be reflected immediately in the Service.
            You will not
            be required to make an additional payment if we raise the prices. We will not refund you any amount when we
            lower the
            rates.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Refunds</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">All sales are final unless you are not satisfied with the purchase. If you are
            not happy with the purchase, you may
            contact us through the contact form on our website or email us asking for a refund. After reviewing your
            request, we may
            refund your payment and revoke further access to the Paid Upgrades. You may not continue using the Paid
            Upgrades after
            you have received a refund. If you make an in-game purchase through Google Play or App Store, we do not
            process any of
            your payment information, and all of the payment is handled by the respective companies.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Your Content</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">Any content that you submit to our Service will remain the property of its
            respective owner. For example, if you upload
            your photo into the game to customize it, the intellectual property right to the photo remains yours. But,
            if you want
            to upload a photo of someone else, or someone else's copyrighted work, you must obtain permission from its
            owner. By
            uploading any content to our Service, you imply that you have the necessary permissions and rights to do so
            from the
            respective owner, and you are allowed by the governing law to do so.</p>

            You also agree that you are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws of Nepal and your
            local laws
            and regulations. In no way shall these Terms limit any consumers' legal rights that you might have.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Legal Binding</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">This is a legally binding agreement between you and SATYAM. This agreement may
            not be transferred to
            another person or company by you, but may be assigned by us to anyone without any restriction. Any attempted
            assignment
            or transfer of this agreement in violation of the above terms shall be null and void. We may modify or
            update these
            Terms in our sole discretion, and indicate the last updated date at the bottom of this page. If you continue
            to use our
            Service after any such change, you signify that you have read and agree to the updated Terms. If you do not
            agree with
            any of the conditions set in these Terms, you should not use our Service. To make sure you do not violate
            any new terms
            you can visit this page and verify the last updated date. Any provision of the agreement, if found illegal
            or void, will
            be eliminated; however, the remainder will continue to hold the full force and effect.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Waiver</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">The event when SATYAM did not take any action or enforce any right or provision
            of these Terms would
            not mean a waiver of such rights or provisions.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-5 mb-4 text-3xl font-semibold" level="2">Amendment</h2>
        <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">We may, without any prior notice, change the nature of delivery or presentation
            of our Service. We may also stop
            providing the Service or some features of the Service to you or all users. We may enforce usage limits for
            the Service.
            We may temporarily or permanently terminate the Service's functionality at our sole discretion. If we
            believe that you
            have violated any provision of these Terms, we may limit, terminate or suspend your access to the Service at
            any time
            without notice and liability of any kind, to the extent permitted by applicable law. We may also limit your
            access to
            the Service without disclosing a reason. You continue to be bound by these Terms with respect to any
            provision which is
            intended to survive termination, even after termination, suspension, or limitation enforced to your access
            to the
            Services.</p>
