      <p class="mt-4 mb-4 text-base">Non-personal information means information that cannot identify you. Such
        information includes your device's make and
        model, version of your operating system, connectivity status, and usage information like which webpages you
        browsed and

        will start deleting information from our databases and storage systems. It may take some time, depending on the
        service
        load and the type of information you requested to delete. We may have retained some of the information in our
        backup
